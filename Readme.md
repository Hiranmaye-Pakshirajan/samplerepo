This folder consists of frontend, backend and intermediate files
The frontend has Hiranmaye's website
The backend has a hello world program in Java 
The intermediate file has nothing in it as of now. (We'll add something to it later on)
Anyways, none of these files are really that related to each other. Its just to test my skills on Git. 
Thanks for reading!
